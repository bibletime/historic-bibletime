	Today we release the final version of BibleTime 0.3.
	0.3 in comparision with 0.3beta1 contains lots of bug fixes and small improvements.
	Major changes:

		export- functions)
		-Better highlighting algorithm in the groupmanager (faster and nicer)
		-Better Drag&Drop: The drag&drop does look now much more nice than before. Thanks go to Martin!
		-Improved graphical search analysis: It does now contain a labelled y-axis so you know how much
		items were found.
		-Complete french, german and italian translations!
		-The handbook is available in German and English
		-Helpdialog files are available in German and English

	Today we released the first beta version of BibleTime 0.3. It's called BibleTime 0.3beta1.
	BibleTime 0.3 is complete rewrite, we have a much better structure now so it's easy to extend
	it in the future.
	Please read the file README and INSTALL for instructions how to build the stuff.
	The final version of 0.3 will probably be released in two weeks if no bug bugs occur.
	Thanks!
