	Today we released the first beta version of BibleTime 0.3. It's called BibleTime 0.3beta1.
	BibleTime 0.3 is complete rewrite, we have a much better structure now so it's easy to extend
	it in the future.
	Please read the file README and INSTALL for instructions how to build the stuff.
	The final version of 0.3 will probably be released in two weeks if no bug bugs occur.
	Thanks!
