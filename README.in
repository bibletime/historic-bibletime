General introduction:
--------------------
	This is BibleTime @VERSION@ for KDE 2. It at the moment in heavy development.
It's the first release which uses KDE2, so some things may not work correctly.
But we don't know bugs in @VERSION@ so things should work properly.
If you find bugs please report them to info@bibletime.de or use our
online bugreport form on www.bibletime.de.

Please do also post suggestions, criticism and moral support to info@bibletime.de .
If you have too much money send it to one of the authors ;-)

Read the file INSTALL how to install and compile this version of BibleTime.
The AUTHORS file contains a list of authors working on BibleTime.
There's also a SPEC file to create RPMs, it's called bibletime.spec.

Now our traditional call for developers and help:
	We are a small team and we need some help
	(especially coding, handbook, translations, graphics stuff etc. ).
	If you think BibleTime is a program which fullfills your needs
	please help us.

This README file contains some very useful instructions and tips how to use BibleTime.
But the handbook is made by Jeff, so it's better!

And sorry for all the spelling errors (grammatical and syntax).

Requirements
------------
	o QT 2.2 (please use 2.1.1 if it's possible, it has lots of bugfixes but 2.1 works, too)
	o KDE 2 final
	o SWORD 1.51a or later

Features
--------
	This is a short list of features so Jeff knows which features exist while writing
	the handbook ;-)
	If you don't know what a button or widget is supposed to do try to use
	SHIFT+F1 and click on the widget. You'll get a short help if it exists.
	If you run BibleTime .3 or later the first time you'll see a startup page
	explaining what BibleTime is and how it works.
	If there are problems with your module installation you'll also get some pages explaining it.
	
	A quick note: Every button and widget in BibleTime supports the "What's this?" feature.
	Simply press SHIFT+F1 and click on a widget.
	A short explanation will popup what this part of BibleTime is supposed to do.
	
-Presenters
	Presenters are the parts of BIbleTime which display content of modules.
	Using this structure we have an open application and it's hopefully easy to use.
	If new module types will be created we simply add a new presenter type.
	Available presenter types are:
	-Bible presenter:
		This presenter shows the content of a Bible module in a suitable form.
		It uses HTML to display the text. The verse numbers are formatted
		as verse references, so you can drag the verse numbers onto the groupmanager to
		create a new bookmark (no working at the moment because we're implementing
		a new Drag&Drop system). You can also click on these references to highlight this verse.
	-Commentary presenter:
		The commentary presenter shows the content of a commentary module
		in a suitable form. It shows only one commentary
		at the same time (on verse), the bible preseter shows a whole chapter.
		There're three comboboxes (book - chapter - verse) to select a key.
		Use TAB to cycle from the first to the last. You can use autocompletion
		in the book combobox (use the RMB menu).
	-Lexicon presenter:
		The lexicon presenter shows the lexicon modules in a suitable form.
		It contains only one combobox and a HTML widget.
		The combobox contains all entries of the lexicon, choose. Use the RMB
		menu to change the autocompletion features of the combobox.
		
-Groupmanager:
	The groupmanager provides access to the modules, provides bookmark-managemen
	and Drag&Drop functions.
	Use the RMB menu to perform actions on modules, bookmarks or groups
	Click on a module to open a presenter for this module, if there's
	already a presenter for the module this presenter will be activated.
	But you may choose RMB->"Create new presenter" to open an additional presenter
	for the module.
	o Bookmarks management
		o Create bookmarks using the RMB menu
			The current presenter is used
		o Delete bookmarks using the RMB menu
		o Export bookmarks to a file using the RMB menu
			This is very useful to distribute your bookmarks
		o Import bookmarks from a file using the RMB menu
			This is very useful to import bookmarks created by other users
			(Use the file they sent you created by exporting the bookmarks)
		o Drag bookmarks around:
			Drop them onto a group to move them (you may sekect more than one bookmark),
			drop them onto a module to open a new presenter for the module showing the key of the bookmark.
			If you drop bookmarks on a free area on the top of the groupmanager the bookmarks are moved
			to the top.
	o Module management
		Modules are displayed as a little book in the tree of the groupmanager.
		o You can unlock modules using the RMB menu (the item is only enabled for enciphered modules)
			Locked modules have a special icon.
		o You can search modules using the RMB menu.
			You can select more than one module, all modules are searched.
		o You can drag the modules around, their position will be saved so they are in the right group
			on the next startup.
	o Group management	
		o Create new groups using the RMB menu
		o Delete groups using the RMB menu
		o Drag groups around:
			Drag groups around and drop them onto other groups or on the top to move them
	o Reseting the groupmanager
		If you messed the items in the groupmanager you can use the item "Reset groupmanager"
		in the context-menu to delete all current items in the tree and to restore
		the default folders of BibleTime.
		
-Noteseditor:
	The noteseditor is not an own window, the editor is integrated in the commentary presenter.
	If a presenter is writeable,
	the "Toggle editmode" button is enabled. Press this button while having a writeable module opened and
	a second toolbar with two buttons and a editline will appear.
	The two buttons are used to save and delete the current comment, the editline contains upper bound of the current comment.
	The lower bound is the cuurent key, you may change the upper bound.
	For example: You are commenting Genesis 1:1 - Genesis 1:31, to do this switch to Genesis 1:1
	and type Genesis 1:31 in the editline of the second toolbar.
	Now save the comment and the key after Genesis 1:1 will be a link to the first key (Genesis 1:1).
	You may use HTML tags while editing the text.
	The editor supports some commands to help editing using HTML commands.
	You may use these keys:
		o	CTRL+B:	Switches bold on or off, depending on context.
			If there's selcted text it will format the selected text bold (putting <B> and </B> around them).
		o	CTRL+I:	Switches italic on or off, depending on context.
			If there's selcted text it will format the selected text italic (putting <I> and </I> around them).
		o CTRL+U: Underline text. Switches underline on or off, depending on context.
			If there'sselcted text pressing these keys will underline the selcted text (putting <U> and </u> arounf the text)
		o CTRL+H: Will format text as heading. This will be switched on or off, depending on context.
			If there's selected text
		o CTRL+R: By pressing these keys the selected text will be formatted as verse reference. For example:
			Select "Genesis 3:5" and press CTRL+R and afetr saving you can view the reference as a link in the presenter.
			Click on it an you'll see Genesis 3:5.
			This is only a temporary solution, it'll will be there until we have a standard.

-Search dialog
	The searchdialog is now in an own dialog, it supports the features of the searchdialog
	of BibleTime 0.2x,but it looking a little bit weird and the grapgical analysis doesn't work yet.
	The searchdialog is a little bit buggy (e.g. sometime "Use last search result" doesn't work correctly).
	o You can drag the found items into the groupmanager so you can easily save the entries you like
	them and use them later
	o You can drag text in the verse preview to the groupmanager (to open a presenter etc.)
	o You can drag verse references from the verse preview on a presenter to change
		the current key of this presenter
	o You can drag verse references from the verse preview on a module to open a new presenter
		for the moduleshowing the key of the verse reference
	o You can use the new improved search analysis. It's the last page of the dialog.
		The number of found items of a is represented by small horizontal lines in the widget.
		If you searched more than one module every module has it's line in a different color.

-Drag&Drop everywhere
	-Martin is doing some great work on Drag'n'Drop.
	You can start a drag almost everywhere. Please play around, you'll find out ;-)
