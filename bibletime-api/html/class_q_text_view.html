The QTextView class provides a sophisticated rich text viewer.
<p>
QTextView is a widget which can show large amounts of read-only text with varying fonts and font attributes, e.g. different point sizes, colors, bold, italic etc. Paragraphs can have different alignments and word-wrap policies. QTextView can also show images (using QMimeSourceFactory), lists and tables. If the text is too large to view within the widget's viewport, scrollbars will appear. The text view can load both plain text and HTML files (a subset of HTML 4 and CSS1 is supported). The rendering style and valid tags are defined by a styleSheet(). Currently a subset of HTML 3.2 and 4, and CSS1 is supported, see setStyleSheet() and <a class="el" href="class_q_style_sheet.html">QStyleSheet</a> for details. The images identified by image tags are displayed if they can be interpreted using the text view's QMimeSourceFactory. (See setMimeSourceFactory() for details.)
<p>
If you want to provide your users with editable rich text use <a class="el" href="class_q_text_edit.html">QTextEdit</a>. If you want a text browser with more navigation use QTextBrowser. If you just need to display a small piece of rich text use QSimpleRichText or QLabel.
<p>
Set the text with setText(). You can include rich text directly in code since it is based on HTML tags, e.g. <div class="fragment"><pre>    textView-&gt;setText( <font class="stringliteral">"&lt;font color=\"red\"&gt;Red&lt;/font&gt;"</font> );
</pre></div> You can append text with append(), for example to display an output log.
<p>
By default the text view will try to guess the format of the text (plain text or HTML) and render accordingly, but you can control this with setTextFormat().
<p>
By default the text view wraps words at whitespace at the width of the text view widget. The setWordWrap() function is used to specify the kind of word wrap you want, or <code>NoWrap</code>. Call setWordWrap() to set a fixed pixel width <code>FixedPixelWidth</code>, or character column (e.g. 80 column) <code>FixedColumnWidth</code> with the pixels or columns specified with setWrapColumnOrWidth(). If you use word wrap to the widget's width <code>WidgetWidth</code>, you can specify whether to break on whitespace or anywhere with setWrapPolicy().
<p>
The background color is set differently from other widgets, using setPaper(). You specify a brush style which could be a plain color or a complex pixmap. Hypertext links are automatically underlined; this can be changed with setLinkUnderline(). The tab stop width is set with setTabStops(). The zoomIn() and zoomOut() functions can be used to resize the text by increasing (decreasing for zoomOut()) the point size by one point per call. Images are not affected.
<p>
The entire text is returned by text(), and the text of a particular paragraph by text(int).
<p>
The user can select text in the text view using the mouse. If they've selected text hasSelectedText() will return TRUE. The selection's position can be obtained with getSelection(), and the selection itself is returned by selectedText(). The selection can be copied to the clipboard with copy(). The entire text can be selected (or deselected) with selectAll().
<p>
The lines() function returns the number of lines in the text, paragraphs() returns the number of paragraphs. The number of lines within a particular paragraph is returned by linesOfParagraph(). The length of the text in characters is returned by length().
<p>
You can scroll to an anchor in the text, e.g. \c{<a name="anchor"></a>} with scrollToAnchor(). The find() function can be used to find and highlight (select) a given string within the text.
<p>
The user can navigate the text view by using the scrollbars and by clicking hypertext links with the mouse. The following keyboard shortcuts are also supported:
<p>
<ul>
<li><em> Up Arrow </em> Move one line up <li><em> Down Arrow </em> Move one line down <li><em> Left Arrow </em> Move one column left <li><em> Right Arrow </em> Move one column right <li><em> Page Up </em> Move one (viewport) page up <li><em> Page Down </em> Move one (viewport) page down <li><em> Home </em> Move to the beginning of the text <li><em> End </em> Move to the end of the text <li><em> Shift+Wheel</em> Scroll the page horizontally (the Wheel is the mouse wheel) <li><em> Ctrl+Wheel</em> Zoom the text <li> </ul>
The text view may be able to provide some meta-information. The documentTitle() function will return the text from within HTML \c{&lt;title&gt;} tags.
<p>
The text displayed in a text view has <em>context</em>. The context is a path which the text view's QMimeSourceFactory uses to resolve the locations of files and images. It is passed to the mimeSourceFactory() when quering data. (See QTextView::QTextView() and context().)
<p>
Note that we do not intend to add a full-featured web browser widget to Qt (because that would easily double Qt's size and only few applications would benefit from it). In particular, the rich text support in Qt is designed to provide a fast, portable and efficient way to add reasonable online help facilities to applications. We will, however, extend it to some degree in future versions of Qt.
