msgid "Our desire is to serve God, and to do our part to help others grow in their relationship with Him. We have found a gaping hole, in that there has been a total lack of user-friendly Bible-study software available for Linux-based computers. We have developed Bibletime to fill that void. We have striven to make this a powerful, quality program, and still make it simple and intuitive to operate. It is our desire that God be praised, as He is the Source of all good things."
