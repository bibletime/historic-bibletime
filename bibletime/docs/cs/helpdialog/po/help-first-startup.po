msgid "MDI is the abbreviation for <emphasis>Multiple Document Interface.</emphasis> With the help of MDI it's possible to have more than one presenter opened at the same time! You may view two different bibles side by side and compare their text. But it's also possible to open only one window as in BibleTime 0.2x. The menu <emphasis>Window</emphasis> is used to work with the MDI interface. The MDI area will only contain presenters, nothing else. This clean presentation avoids confusing users with too many choices."

msgid "A display window is a window inside the MDI area of BibleTime. A display window presents the content of a document (SWORD module) in a reasonable format (for example Bibles will be displayed as HTML text with hyperlinks to verse references). We use display windows to have a general approach for the future. Crosswire will extend SWORD as more material is made available for distribution. When new module types are created for Sword we will simply create additional types of display windows. This approach makes BibleTime extensible in the future, and able to display any type of module that might be created in (for example maps or sound modules ...)."
