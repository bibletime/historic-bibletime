msgid "A SWORD module is the base of BibleTime. A module may be a Bible, a commentary or a lexicon. Later we will have maps and other interesting stuff. It's not possible to use with BibleTime if no modules are installed although it's possible to test BibleTime without installed modules. When modules are displayed in bibletime we call them documents."
