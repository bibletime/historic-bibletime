            <td bgcolor="#EBDCB6">The searchdialog is the dialog where you can search in the modules of Sword.
            You can enter text and search this text in the modules. The found entries will appear in a list where you can work with them.

        <tr>
            <td bgcolor="#21A7D4"><B>How do I search for some text?</B></td>
            <td bgcolor="#EBDCB6">To search some text click on the first entry of the tabbed bar at the top of the dialog.
            Now enter some text in the editable line at the top. If you don't want to do special things you can leave the settings untouched and click on the
            "Search" button and the bottom of the dialog. The progress of the search will be displayed in the two bars at the bottom. The first bar
            shows the progress for the current module, the second one does show the percentage of the whole search. It's possible to search more than one module so two bars are required.<BR>
            But if you want to do more things with the searchdialog we offer these settings to you:
            <DL>
                <DT>Multiple words</DT>
                    <DD>The entered words can occur in another order as entered in the line, they can even be part of more than one word.</DD>
                <DT>Exact search</DT>
                    <DD>The text is exactly searched as enetered in the line, unless you enabled case sensitive search the search does case insensitive search.</DD>
                <DT>Regular expressions</DT>
                    <DD>If you use this type of search GNU standad regular expressions are used.</DD>
            </DL>
            Normally all searches are done with insensitive chararcter mathcing, to use case sensitive search enable the box "Case sensitive".<BR>
            If you have problems with the search types, case (in)sensitive search or other search related things have a look into our handbook for more information.
