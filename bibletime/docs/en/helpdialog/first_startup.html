            of MDI it's possibble to have more than one presenter opened at the same time! You may view two different
            bibles side by side and compare directly their text. But it's also possible to open only one
            window like in BibleTime 0.2x. The menu <B>Window</B> is used to work with the MDI interface.<BR>
            The MDI area will only contain presenters, nothing else. This is done in this way because other dialogs would
            confuse lots of users.

            <td bgcolor="#EBDCB6">A presenter is a window inside the MDI area of BibleTime. A presenters presents
            the content of a SWORD module in a reasonable format (for example Bibles will be displayed as HTML text with hyperlinks
            to verse references).
            <BR>We use presenters to have a general approach for the future:
            SWORD will be extended more and more and new module type will be created. We simply create a new presenter type for a new module type,
            isn't this easy to understand? BibleTime will be extensible in the future, no matter what types of modules will be created (e.g. maps
            or sound modules ...).

            The groupmanager combines the bookmarkmanagement and modulemanagement of BibleTime 0.2x.
            To work with the Groupmanager use the right mousebutton menu.<BR>
            The groupmanager is Drag 'n' Drop capable: You can drag verse references of a presenter into the groupmanager to create a bookmark,
            and you can move items in the tree (e.g. move groups or bookmarks into another group)</td>
