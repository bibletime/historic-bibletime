            <td bgcolor="#EBDCB6">For normal users it's sadly not possible at this time to use encrypted modules.
            The problem is that the copyright owners of the modules do not want to release the stuff together with
            SWORD.<BR>But I you have a key click with the right mousebutton on the module and select "Unlock module ...".
            A dialog appears, please enter here the key to unlock the encrypted dmoule.

            <td bgcolor="#21A7D4"><b>Why are modules locked?</b> </td>
            <td bgcolor="#EBDCB6">Modules are locked because the copyright owners of the module do not want to release
            their texts together with the SWORD project.<BR>
            Please contact the copyright owners and ask for the modules. I you want to pay for it please let them know, this
            is a thing they like. We know freely available module would be great, so try to get them!<BR>
            You can also visit <A HREF="http://www.bibletime.de/">www.bibletime.de</A> and read the "Module" section,
            there is contact information. If your country isn't listed there please create such a page and sent them to us!<BR>
