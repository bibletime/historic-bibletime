            of MDI it's possible to have more than one presenter opened at the same time! You may view two different
            bibles side by side and directly compare their text. But it's also possible to open only one
            window as was done in BibleTime 0.2x. The menu <B>Window</B> is used to apply BibleTime features (for example the
            search dialog) to the contents of presenters in the MDI interface.<BR>
            The Bibletime team wants to make this software user friendly, so we are making every effort to make Bibletime simple.
            For this reason the MDI window will only display presenters.

            <td bgcolor="#EBDCB6">A presenter is a window inside the MDI area of BibleTime. A presenters presents
            the content of a SWORD module in a reasonable format (for example Bibles will be displayed as HTML text with hyperlinks
            to verse references).
            <BR>We use presenters to have a general approach for the future:
            <BR>Crosswire will extend SWORD as more material is made available for distribution.
            <BR>When new module types are created for Sword we will simply create additional presenters.
            <BR>This approach makes BibleTime extensible in the future, and able to display any type of module that might be created
            in (for example maps or sound modules ...).

            To work with the Groupmanager use the right mousebutton menu.<BR>
            The groupmanager is Drag 'n' Drop enabled: You can drag verse references of a presenter into the groupmanager to create a bookmark,
            and you can move items in the tree (e.g. move groups or bookmarks into another group)</td>
