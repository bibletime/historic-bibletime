msgid "The solution is to create a directory mods.d: Please go into your SWORD directory and type \"mkdir mods.d\" to create the directory. Now copy the config files of your modules into this package and remove (if they exist) the file mods.conf which isn't required any more. The mods.d directory replaced this file."

msgid "Yes, it's possible. But it's not very useful. There are no modules in the groupmanager. It's possible to test Bibletime this way, but it's not possible to work with it without modules."
