<h3><A NAME=install>Installation problems</A></h3>

<table border cellpadding=2>
  <tr valign=top>
    <td><h4>Why do I see only verse numbers, but no text?</h4></td>
    <td>Please make sure that the Bible or commentary you selected contains both testaments (OT and NT).
        Some modules contain only the new testament (e.g. the GerBen module).
        If the module has both the problem is probably caused by wrong permissions of the data files.
        Please set the right permissions of the file and directories.<BR>
        The best solution is to create a group called sword and put in this group every user who wants to use BibleTime.<BR>
        Now set read-write permissions for the group and change the ownership of every file in the Sword directory to <TT>root:sword</TT>.<BR>
        Execute the following commands to solve the problems:
<pre>
 <I>#create a group called sword
 #then:</I>
 cd &lt;your path to SWORD&gt;
 chown root:sword modules mods.d -R
 chmod a+r+X modules/ mods.d/ -R
 chmod g+r+w+X modules/ mods.d/ -R
 chmod u+r+w+X modules/ mods.d/ -R
</pre>
        These commands set the permission that everybody can read the files,  but only the members of the group <TT>sword</TT>
        and the owner (<TT>root</TT>) can write to the files. You need write access for the personal commentary module.

<h3><A NAME=develop>Development</A></h3>

<table border cellpadding=2>
<tr valign=top>
 <td><h4>How do I get the development version?</h4></td>
 <td>Please see the <A HREF=http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=954>cvs instructions</A> on how to get the CVS version of bibletime.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><h4>May I support you?</h4></td>
  <td>Yes! We are glad for every your offer to help us. Please send an eMail to
    <A HREF="mailto:info@bibletime.de">info@bibletime.de</A> and tell us what you
    are able to do (programming, translations etc.). We will help you to get started soon.<BR>
    See our <A HREF=http://sourceforge.net/docman/index.php?group_id=954>developer instructions.</A></td>
</tr>
<trvalign=top>
  <td><h4>Why do you release so few versions of BibleTime?</h4></td>
  <td>We are unable to release more versions because we are a very small team. We can not
     program faster, we need more developers. If you are able to program and want to help
     please send an eMail to <A HREF="mailto:info@bibletime.de">info@bibletime.de</A>.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
  <td><h4>Which IDE should I use to work on BibleTime?</h4></td>
  <td>We do not depend on an IDE to work on BibleTime. But we would recommend
    <A HREF=www.kdevelop.org>KDevelop 1.4</A> or later, because this
    integrates with KDE 2.x.</td>

<h3><A NAME=misc>Misc things</A></h3>
<table border cellpadding=2>
<tr valign=top>
  <td><h4>Is there a CD with all sword modules and sword frontend programs?</h4></td>
  <td>Yes, there's such a CD! The Crosswire Bible society, which provides the texts does also provide
    a CD containing the texts, the Windows frontend, some Linux frontends, fonts etc.<BR>
    We ship the CD in Europe for the Crosswire Bible Society. Crosswire ships the CDs in the USA and all other countries except Europe.
    You can get such a CD <A HREF="http://www.bibletime.de/sword_cd.shtml">here</A>.</td>
