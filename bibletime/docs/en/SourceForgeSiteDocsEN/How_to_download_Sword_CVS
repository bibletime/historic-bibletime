<!-- only part below is in the sourceforge site docs ->
<p>DO NOT use the sword CVS with released versions of bibletime.&nbsp; We
do not test this configuration so it will probably will not work.
<p>If you are compiling bibletime from the CVS, you will need to use the
current version of the sword CVS.&nbsp; As both sword and bibletime are
under continous development, there are times where one or both of these
CVS files will contain bugs.
<p>If you have problems with the CVS you can post a bug report to bt-devel@crosswire.org
If you need to report a bug with an RPM please use the bug reporting feature
on https://sourceforge.net/projects/bibletime/
<p>Always install sword before compiling bibletime.
