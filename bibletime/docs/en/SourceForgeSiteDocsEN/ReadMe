This directory contains the english sourceforge site documents for Bibletime.
These files should not be available in the RPM binaries.
The intent of placing these files here in the CVS tree
is to make it easier to modify them, and create translations.

Meta data tags and header tags were added so that these files view as html pages.
These should be stripped out when adding to the sourceforge site document tree.

Example showing use of meta tags (must be opened in a text editor to view this).
