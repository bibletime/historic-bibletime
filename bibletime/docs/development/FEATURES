This is a feature list for BibleTime 1.0 CVS
-----------------------------------------------

I do list here the major parts of BibleTime with their different functions.

-Mainwindow
	-menubar
	-configurable toolbar
	-splitted into two parts: the groupmanager and the MDI area for the presenters
	
-Groupmanager
	-The groupmanager is the "control center" of BibleTime. Here you can open presenter,
	open the search dialog to search in one or more modules,
	-create, delete, import, export, print, drag and drop bookmarks
	-create and delete groups
	-Supports drag & drop
		x you can drag the verse numbers of the presenters and drop them on the GM
		x from the searchdialog (you can drag the found items (one by one) ) and drop them on the GM
	-Move around bookmarks, groups and modules by Drag&Drop
	-Saves and restores the positions of bookmarks, groups and modules
	

-MDI area
	-Manages the presenters
	-Tile and cascade the windows
	-Supports automatically tiling and cascading of the windows
	if the MDI area was resized or a new window was opened or closed

-Presenters
	-For every type of module there's one type of presenter (for example for Bibles we have an own Commentary presenter)
	-Each type of presenter has an own interface
	-Bible presenter:
		Buttons and list to:
			o Choose the book
			o Choose the chapter
			o Choose the verse
			o Go the the next/previous book/chapter/verse
		Special keychooser function: Use the small button in the middle of the three
		to scroll through the list very fast and easy. This is a neat function.
	-Commentary presenter
		The commentary presenter has all buttons and lists of the Bible presenter and
		a additional button to switch into the edit-mode (edit the commentary if possible).
		o Edit mode:
			Switching to the edit mode hides the HTML widget and shows a
			WYSIWYG edit widget (not yet working properly), you can format the text bold, italic, underlined,
			choose different fonts and fontsizes.
			
	-Lexicon presenter
		The lexicon presenter contains only one listbox and the three buttons		
		The middle button has the same cool functionality as the one in the Bible presenter
		The listbox contains the items available in the module


-Search interface
	-Search text in modules
	-You can search more than one module
	 (select the modules which should be searched through in the groupmanager)
	-We have three different search methods:
		-Exact phrase
			Searches eact the text entered in the edit line
		-Multiple words
			You can search for multiple words, the order is not important.
			This type of search (non-case sensitive) may have an index file is faster than the other methods
		-Regular expressions
			You can use regular expressions to define your searched text
			(Hint: Maybe an introduction to RegExp is good (the Windows Sword program help has one))
	-The searcg result is shown in the second tab page, the modules are on the left,
		the found items of the selected modules in the list on the left
		You can drag the items away or print them
	-The last tab page contains the graphical search analysis,
		which shows the search result in a diagram
	
-Printing interface
	You can print keys (e.g. bookmarks, search results, verses in the presenter)
	The printed keys may have a range (e.g. "Genesis 1:1 - Genesis 1:2")
	The items which should be printed are collected in the printer-dialog itemlist.
	If you want to print them assign a style to tem if necessary and
	if like press "Preview" before using the print button
  x Styles:
  	Styles are formatting rules for the keys which should be printed
  	Styles consist of three parts with the same formatting rules:
  		- Header
  		- Description
  		- Text
  	The user can edit all of them to define the look of the printed keys
  You can create, edit, import (later), export (later) and delete styles. For
  these actions use the bttons on the right side of the style list.

	Printing is not yet finished completely, but it is working.


Help system:
------------
	At every point in the program you can press SHIFT+F1 to switch to
	the "What's this?" mode.
	If you are in this mode and click on a widget you'll get
	a short explanation what this is.
	BibleTime has a handbook :)
	BibleTime opens a helpdialog in some cases
		-BibleTiem was started the first time
		-Some pages exists if the Sword path, the modules or the configs can't be found
		-If an encrypted module was opened the first time
