If you don't want to do special things you can leave the settings untouched and click on the <guibutton>Search</guibutton> button at the bottom of the dialog. The progress of the search will be displayed in the two bars at the bottom. The first bar shows the progress for the current module, the second one does show the percentage of the whole search. It's possible to search more than one module so two bars are required. But if you want to do more things with the search dialog we offer these settings to you:"
