The preferred method of installing the global configuration if you installed &sword; from the cvs or a tarball is to cd to the directory containing your sword source, and <command>make install_config</command>. The global configuration will be placed into <filename>/etc/sword.conf</filename>. If you have a nonstandard installation where <filename>/etc/sword.conf</filename> can not be set, then set <command>SWORD_PATH</command> to the location of your sword modules directory. For example in &Linux-Mandrake; adding the line <command>export SWORD_PATH=/usr/share/sword</command> to <filename>~/.bash_profile</filename> or <filename>/etc/bashrc</filename> is the same as <filename>/etc/sword.conf</filename> containing the line <command>/usr/share/sword</command>"
