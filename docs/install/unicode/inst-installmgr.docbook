<title>How to install and use &swordInstmgr;</title>
<para>&swordInstmgr; is not provided with the &bibletime; .rpm.  You need to download the
source tarball from the <ulink url="http://www.crosswire.org">&crosswire;</ulink>.
A precompiled copy of &swordInstmgr; is included on the &sword; CD which can be obtained
from the <ulink url="http://www.crosswire.org">&crosswire;</ulink>

<title> Requirements for &swordInstmgr;</title>

	<para>
	All of the packages required for &swordInstmgr; to compile are included in the major
	&Linux; distributions. It is also possible to compile &swordInstmgr; on most &UNIX;
	distributions.  If you encounter compile errors, please read the messages, they
	should lead you to missing packages which you will probably find on your
	installation disks. </para>
	<para> The following table contains the minimum requirements for &swordInstmgr;

	<para>To compile &swordInstmgr; first &sword; must have been compiled.

	<para>Find the file <filename> libsword.so</filename>, &sword; probably installed it to
	<filename>/usr/local/sword/lib</filename> unless you customized the installation.
	</para>
	<para>
	In order that &swordInstmgr; (and also &bibletime;) can find this shared library
	open a text editor and add <filename>/usr/local/sword/lib</filename> to the
	end of <filename>/etc/ld.so.conf</filename>.
	</para>
	<para>
	Now you are ready to compile &swordInstmgr;.
	</para>
	<para>
	CD to your &sword; source and open the directory
	<filename>.../sword/apps/X11/InstallMgr</filename>.
	Now in a shell do:
	</para>
	<screen>
	ldconfig
	./configure
	make
	su
	make install
	</screen>
	<para>
	Now in a shell as root (su) you can run installmgr by typing
	<filename>/usr/local/bin/installmgr</filename>.
	</para>
	<para>
	If this was successful, there are two options for loading
	text modules into &sword;.

	<title>Setting up your repository</title>
	<para>If you have the &sword; CD, you can skip this step.  The texts are stored on the CD
	uncompressed, and are accessed directly from installmgr under the manage remote sources tab.
	</para>
	<para>
	Download modules from <ulink url="http://www.crosswire.org">&crosswire;</ulink>
	use the zipped up modules (modulename.zip),
	not the windows executable compressed files (modulename.exe).
	</para>
	<para>
	Create a directory for your module repository, <filename>$HOME/sword_modules</filename>
	for example.
	</para>
	<para>
	Open a program that can uncompress zip files.  Such as gnozup or archiver.  Command line
	tools can also be used, to find which ones are installed on your system do a <command>man -k zip</command>
	</para>
	<para>
	Use your unzipping program to extract the module files into <filename>$HOME/sword_modules</filename>.
	All of the files will be placed into the correct subdirectories. If you wish to add modules later
	remember to unzip to <filename>$HOME/sword_modules</filename>.

	<title>Using &swordInstmgr; to load sword modules.</title>
	<para>
	You must start &swordInstmgr; as root for it to be able to load modules.
	Start it with these commands:
	</para>
	<screen>
	[me@localhost user]$ su
	Password:
	[root@localhost user]# /usr/local/bin/installmgr
	</screen>
	<para>
	You will now see the installmgr window.  You will need to use
	<guimenu>options>local path</guimenu> to point to your local module repository.
	</para>
	<para>
	Now the available modules will be shown on the left pane and
	the installed modules on the right.  All you need to do is
	select modules in the left pane and click install to make them
	available to &sword; and &bibletime;.
