We have found a gaping hole, in that there has been a total lack of user-friendly Bible-study software available for &Linux;-based computers. We have developed &bibletime; to fill that void. We have striven to make this a powerful, quality program, and still make it simple and intuitive to operate. It is our desire that God be praised, as He is the source of all good things."
