granted that behind them all was a single divine Author.  He could equally say
'Moses said' or 'God said' (Mk.7:10). He could quote a comment of the narrator in
Genesis 2:24 as an utterance of the Creator Himself (Mt.19:4-5).  Similarly He
said, 'Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written', when what He
went on to quote is the direct speech of the Lord God (Mk.7:6 &amp; Is.29:13).  It
is from Jesus Himself that the New Testament authors have gained their
conviction of the dual authorship of Scripture.  For them it was just as true to
say that 'God spoke of old to our fathers by the prophets' (Heb.1:1) as it was to
say that 'men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God' (2 Pe.1:21).  God did not
speak in such a way as to obliterate the personality of the human authors, nor
did men speak in such a way as to corrupt the Word of the divine Author.  God
spoke.  Men spoke.  Neither truth must be allowed to detract from the other. ...

This, then, was Christ's view of the Scriptures.  Their witness was God's
witness. The testimony of the Bible is the testimony of God.  And the chief
reason why the Christian believes in the divine origin of the Bible is that
Jesus Christ Himself taught it.  </p></td><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="right" valign="top">--<span class="attribution">John R.W. Stott, <span class="emphasis"><i>Christ the Controversialist</i></span>,

finality of God's initiative in Christ is conveyed by one word of the Greek
Testament, namely the adverb <i>hapax</i> and
<i>ephapax</i>. It is usually translated in the
Authorized Version once, meaning once for all. It is used of what is so done as
to be of perpetual validity and never need repetition, and is applied in the NT
to both revelation and redemption.  Thus, Jude refers to the faith which was
once for all delivered to the saints (Jude 3), and Romans says,
"<span class="emphasis"><i>Christ also died for sins once for all</i></span>"
(Rom.6:10, see also 1 Pe.3:18; Heb.9:26-28). </p><p>
Thus we may say that God has spoken once
for all and Christ has suffered once for all.  This means that the Christian
revelation and the Christian redemption are both alike in Christ complete.
Nothing can be added to either without being derogatory to Christ...  These are
the two rocks on which the Protestant Reformation was built -- Gods revealed
word without the addition of human traditions and Christ's finished work without
the addition of human merits.  The Reformers great watchwords were <i>sola
scriptura</i> for our authority and <i>sola gratia</i> for our salvation.</p></td><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="right" valign="top">--<span class="attribution">John R. W. Stott, <span class="emphasis"><i>Christ the Controversialist,</i></span>
