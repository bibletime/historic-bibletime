figurative language be figurative.

Rule 2, context:  seems to confuse us even
more.  It doesn't seem to fit with what goes before and after!  This should tip us off that we aren't
understanding it rightly!!</p><p>What we have here is a Hebrew idiom,  &#8220;evil eye&#8221;.  Let's look up other uses of this idiom: Mt.20:15
"<span class="emphasis"><i>Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with what is my own?  Or is your eye envious [lit."evil"] because I
am generous [lit. "good"]?</i></span>"  We find that having an "evil eye" is a Hebrew idiom for being stingy or envious.
Now go back to Mt.6 and notice how this understanding ties in so perfectly to the context.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="h2-rules-normal-ex4b"></a>Example 4B</h3></div></div><p>Is.59:1 &#8220;The Lord's hand is not short;&#8221;</p><p>Deut.33:27 &#8220;Underneath are the everlasting arms.&#8221;</p><p>
References to body parts of God are used by Latter-Day Saints to prove that God was once a man just as we
are.  Once they convince people of that, they go on to teach that we can become God just like He is!  At a
lecture he was giving, a group of Mormon elders challenged Walter Martin (author of <span class="emphasis"><i>Kingdom of the Cults</i></span>)
with an enumeration of verses like these.  Dr. Martin then asked the Mormons to read one more scripture:
Ps.91:4  &#8220;He will cover you with His feathers; And under His wings shalt thou trust&#8221;.  W.M. said, &#8220;By the same
rules of interpretation that you just proved God to be a man, you just proved that He is a bird&#8221;.  The Mormons
had to laugh as they realised the ridiculousness of their position.
