ToDo file for BibleTime @VERSION@

Help wanted
-----------

We do especially need developers, but there are also other jobs like
documentation writing, translating, artwork etc.
For further information, see www.bibletime.de
and www.sourceforge.net/projects/bibletime.

Important unimplemented things:
-------------------------------
	-searchdialog
		o Better interface so it's more easy to use (thanks to Dre for the suggestions)
		o perhaps RegExp edit widget (later)
	-Installmanager
	-Morphological analysis (maybe in 2.0 :)

Things which should be optimized:
---------------------------------
	[partly] Search for mem leaks
	[partly] Optmize memory usage
	[partly] Check BibleTime with a profiler and optimize the time consuming functions

Features we are thinking about:
------------------------------
	-Commandline options: Implement commandline options to control BibleTime
	  (e.g. open presenters, lookup verses and exit, import bookmarks and exit etc.	)

	
For a more up-to-date list of task please have a look at www.sourceforge.net/projects/bibletime/!


Thank you!
