ToDo file for BibleTime @VERSION@

Help wanted
-----------
WE NEED YOUR HELP!

The team of active developers is very small, often only 1 person.
We are desperately looking for people who are
a)willing to learn
b)willing to contribute over a longer period of time
c)are not perfect ;)
We do especially need developers, but there are also other jobs like
documentation writing, translating, artwork etc.
For further information, see www.bibletime.de
and www.sourceforge.net/projects/bibletime.

WE REALLY NEED YOU!

Important unimplemented things:
-------------------------------
	-searchdialog
		o perhaps RegExp edit widget (later)
	-ThML support for presenters
    o create a QT3::QRichtext derived ThML widget

Things which should be optimized:
---------------------------------
-Search for mem leaks (I'm sure there are at least 100 :)
-Optmize memory usage
-Thread safety
 (We should implement and use CModuleInfo's copy constructor)
-Check BibleTime with a profiler and optimize the time consuming functions
-We need a much faster search analysis

Features we are thinking about:
------------------------------
	-A sermon backend to make it easier to write full featured sermons
	-Dialog to install SWORD mdules
		(automatically Download, automatic installation and problem checking)
	-Commandline options: Implement commandline options to control BibleTime
	  (e.g. open presenters, lookup verses and exit, import bookmarks and exit etc.	)
