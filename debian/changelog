bibletime (0.31-3.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload (Ben Burton <benb@acm.org>).
  * Rebuilt with new Qt libs (closes: #89789).
  * Build-Depends: Replaced kdebase-dev with kdelibs-dev; removed
    autoconf (redundant); added libtool.
  * Replaced admin/debianrules with a newer version and modified
    debian/rules to use admin/debianrules; this way everything gets
    installed into the correct directory; this also required modifying
    $(localedir) in po/Makefile.am.
  * Added debian menu item, lintian overrides file and doc-base registration.
  * In debian/rules, using configure-stamp instead of configure.stamp
    (this stops ./configure being run again and again and again).
  * In debian/rules, deletes Makefile.ins on "make clean" and recreates
    them during "make configure"; this removes some unnecessary junk
    from the debian diff.gz file.
