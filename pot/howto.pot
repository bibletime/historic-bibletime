"What we have here is a Hebrew idiom, \"evil eye.\" Let's look up other uses "
"of this idiom: Mt.20:15 \"<emphasis>Is it not lawful for me to do what I "
"wish with what is my own? Or is your eye envious [lit.\"evil\"] because I am "
"generous [lit.\"good\"]?</emphasis>\" We find that having an \"evil eye\" is "
"a Hebrew idiom for being stingy or envious. Now go back to Mt.6 and notice "
"how this understanding ties in so perfectly to the context."

"Is.59:1 \"<emphasis>The Lord's hand is not short;</emphasis>\" Deut.33:27 "
"\"<emphasis>Underneath are the everlasting arms.</emphasis>\" References to "
"body parts of God are used by Latter-Day Saints to prove that God was once a "
"man just as we are. Once they convince people of that, they go on to teach "
"that we can become God just like He is! At a lecture he was giving, a group "
"of Mormon elders challenged Walter Martin (author of <emphasis>Kingdom of "
"the Cults</emphasis>) with an enumeration of verses like these. Dr. Martin "
"then asked the Mormons to read one more scripture: Ps.91:4 \"<emphasis>He "
"will cover you with His feathers; And under His wings shalt thou trust.</"
"emphasis>\" W.M. said, \"By the same rules of interpretation that you just "
"proved God to be a man, you just proved that He is a bird.\" The Mormons had "
"to laugh as they realised the ridiculousness of their position."

"Some parables are allegories, for instance, the parable of the sower is an "
