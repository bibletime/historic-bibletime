%description
BibleTime %{version}-%{release} is a free and easy to use bible study tool for UNIX systems.

BibleTime provides easy handling of digitalized texts (Bibles, commentaries and lexicons) and powerful features to work with these texts (search in texts, write own notes, save, print etc.). Bibletime is a frontend for the  SWORD Bible Framework.

This is  a relocatable package, you can install it on different target with
rpm -Uvh bibletime-xxx.rpm --prefix /usr/local/opt/apps/noncommercial
default is %{_prefix}

The SWORD Project is an effort to create an ever expanding software package for research and study of God and His Word.  The SWORD Bible Framework allows easy manipulation of Bible texts, commentaries, lexicons, dictionaries, etc.  Many frontends are build using this framework.  An installed module set may be shared between any frontend using the framework.

This rpm was compiled on a %{ostype} %{osversion} system for %{buildarch} class cpu's.

This RPM has these compiled options Sword is compiled %{swordlibs} and KDE/QT is compiled %{kdelibs}.

Although this binary no longer requires sword to run the source.rpm will not build correctly
without the sword-devel package installed.
