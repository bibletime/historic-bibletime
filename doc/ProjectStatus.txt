describing BibleTime 0.1

Ok,
this is ought to be a project status report. It displays my opinion
on the project and the next few steps we should take in order to effectively
develop BibleTime.

What do we have:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have a bible study tool :)
BibleTime (BT) is probably at the moment the most advanced bible app for Linux.
There ARE people out there who are waiting for something like BT.

Main Features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Parallel views of texts, lexicons and commentaries
* searching (although not that much advanced but offering a good amount
  of capabilities
* search scope is adjustable in a limited way
* A result list view (one can process the resulting verses
  further (printing...))
* We have printing support (from the result list or one can directly
  print displayed text)
* printing is configurable though our options dialog, so are short keys etc.
* we have an integrated editor for personal comment (even with spell checker :))
* we can link to HREF´s (try the JFB module which includes href´s to texts
* if a link (http://..) is found in a text (eg. personal)
  it´s made to a HTML link (but it needs further thought whether to display
  linked text in the widget or in kfm. Currently all is displayed in the widget.)
* we can add personal comments
* we have (nearly) working bookmark management. I will submit it as soon as
  configure management is working again.

* the view we have is configurable
* there is probably much more

What we don´t have:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* We don´t have a handbook describing the most important features
* configure management is broken at the moment

* There are tons more which are documented in the TODO file but I don´t
  think they´re neccessary for a first release.

Now I come to the point: the first release.

I think we should ASAP release a 0.1 version of BT.

Reasons:
~~~~~~~~

* There are people waiting and eager to try it out.
* At least for me it is reasonably stable.
* To get more attention and hopefully more developers interested
  in the project.
* to enlarge the number of users who are willing to test
  BT and report bugs and give hints on what we could improve.

Next steps:
~~~~~~~~~~~

I think we should release a 0.1 during the next coupe of weeks.
I could think of a time of 2 to 3 weeks from now.

We need to fix configure management, it will then include
searching for the sword libs as well as a --with-sworddir option.

Write a handbook stub which includes the most important features
and things the user needs to know in order to use BT.

The configure stuff was Joergs duty till now, is it ok if you take care of it?

Who is willing to write a part of the handbook? Heiner? Joachim?

Who does the promotion when 0.1 is released (ads at freshmeat...)? Joachim?

These thoughts can also be used for the handbook to be written
(feature list)

Please tell me your thoughts, and lets get the horse running...

God bless you,
Torsten!
