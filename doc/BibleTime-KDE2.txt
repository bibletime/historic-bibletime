BibleTime for KDE 2
--------------------
This document tries to make some guidelines for the next BibleTime version,
which will be based on KDE 2. The next version of BibleTime will be called
"BibleTime 0.3".

In my opinion we should try to make BibleTime the standard Bible software on
Linux/Unix. To do this we need standards: Standards of BibleTime GUI,
standards of file formats ...

GUI guidelines and functions:
-----------------------------
	-MDI support. BibleTime 0.3 should use QextMDI for MDI. MDI stands for
    Multi Document Interface. The different parts will be windows in the BibleTime
    main-window
	-Perhaps use a tHTML widget instead of a HTML widget
	-Parallel scrolling of several windows (bibles and commentaries)
	-Don't use the KWrite widget for the noteseditor - makes BibleTime
bloatware
 	-Make the GUI as easy to use as possible
	-Drag and Drop support everywhere: For example drag and drop in the
	 boomarkmanager, between the noteseditor and the browserparts, drag and drop of
    single verses ... 	
	-GROUP manager: the group manager is like the bookmarkmanager, but you
    can organize everything in groups, e.g. drop groups from the modulelist into
    the manager, have some single verses, chapters or books organized in different
    groupps. This is an alternative to the modules-manager. If the user likes the
    groupmanager he can hide the modulesselecetor and use the grop-manager
	-We should make everything organizable in groups
	-Drag and drop of grouplelements into the printerqueue
	-Perhaps make use of threads ( possible? )?
	-Better internet-support. Support for bookmarks to URLs, browsing ...
	-every action (even RMB-menus) should be possible witht the help of
    the keyboard
	-load textfilters (e.g. gbf-to-html) as plugins, this makes it
    possible to load filters from enterprises which provided own modules (perhaps
    in future)
	-Management of modules via RMB menu in the module-tree. For example
    implement possibility to set the cipher key of a module, read copyright infos of
    a module ...

Programming guidelines:
-----------------------
	-Comment _each_ function in the headerfiles. Make use of kdoc to make
    it easy to create HTML files for class documentation
	-Every classname should begin with a C, for example CChartWidget

Documentation guidelines:
-------------------------
	-Make use of the doctools, don't use sgmltools in BibleTime 0.3
    because KDE 2 doesn't use it, too.
    The doctools provide better handling for tables, images etc.

Global comments // Torsten Uhlmann // TUhlmann@gmx.de
=====================================================
Here are some comments on the above:

   - Much of the above said is too much for a version 0.3. If we want to
     implement this we need more developers and I would estimate more than
     half a year! I think we should stick to the policy: Release early and often!

   - We should said up a roadmap for the above said, so we don´t forget anything
     but have scheduled it with the right priorities.

   - My opinion about changes for a 0.3: Switch to KDE2 and everything that
     is neccessary for not doing the work twice, like cleaning up code
     restructuring etc. But I would be _very_ careful with too much new features.
     Lets rather have an early 0.3 where people can play with and then incorporate
     bug fixes, ideas and build on further from the stage.
