Concerning BibleTime 1.0

We should not try to satisfy the whole ThML standard, because it contains tags
that will never be useful in BibleTime, and tags we will not need in 1.0.
We should rather start with the tags that are necessary to get commentaries etc.
working, like the scripture reference tags and similar.

I will now list the tags and comment on which tags are useful in BibleTime 1.0.
I will mark the tags which are SWORD tasks with NO, because we won't have to
care for them.
