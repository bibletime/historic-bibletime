Here's a list of useful QT 2.1.x (CVS) and KDE 2 (CVS) classes which we could / should use in BibleTime 0.3.

QT 2.1.x:
	-QCanvas souns interesting.
		QCanvas is a 2D drawing area which is much faster in comparision with a widget.
		Never used, but perhaps useful for the graphical search analysis.
	-Geometry management:
		-QVBox: Vertical layout of children
		-QHBox:	Horizontal layout of children
		-QHButtonGroup: Handles QButtons (horizontal).
		-QVButtonGroup: Handles QButtons (vertical).
		If we use the QT layout management we don't have to reimplement these stupid resizeEvent functions, which
		will save lots of time.
	-QMouseEvent: With the help of QMouseEvent we can implement support for wheel mice. Would be cool although I hav no wheel mouse.
	-QWhatsThis: Simple description of any widget, e.g. answering the question "what's this?"
	-QWorkspace: New clsss. Provides a MDI like working area. Easy to use. I think we should use this for MDI.
		But probably a lack of function: It doesn't provide the possibility to arrange the child widgets and no possibility to add popup menus to the childs.

KDE 2:
	-kdecore
		-KInstance: Provides acces to KDE global objects in shared libraries
		-KLibLoader: Load shared lobraries at runtime. Useful for our plugin interface.
	-kdeui
		-KAboutDialog: The new aboutdialog for each application. I think we should use it.
		-KApplet: Implements a panel applet. Perhaps useful.
		-KContextMenuManager: Opens a popupmenu if you click with the RMB on a QWidget given in the constructor.
			Useful, because we save the time to implement mouseClick event of thw widget
		-KJanusWidget: Provides some ready to use dialog layouts. Useful for the optionsdialog (tree-view).
			Very neat interface.
		-KEdit: Edit widget. It's improved now. I think we should use it instead of the large KWrite widget. Doesn't provide syntax highlighting.
		-KLineEditDlg:	Provides a dialog to enter a single line of text
		-KPopupMenu: A improved QPopupMenu which provides the possibility to insert titles in the menu. USeful.
	-mediatool
		-KAudio: Easy to use class to play wav-files using the KAudioserver
	-dcop: This library is used to comunicate with other applications using the dcop-interface.
		I've never used this that's why I can't give hints how to use this.
	-khtml: This class provides the HTML widget which uses now Java, Javascript (early beginnings), CSS 2 (beginnings) and the like

	
I think I forgot some useful classes. I havn't covered most the improved widgets.
I havn't described the  Drag and Drop handling, but  there's a tuotrial in
the QT 2.x documentation.
